# Guess Age API Project

'Guess Age' is a project that uses your name to predict your age. Making use of the Agify API.

## Technologies Used 

 React
 Material UI
 Axios
 agify.io


### Approaches

I began designing the layout on paper, keeping in mind how many elements would be required: a title, a button, one input, one output, and an error.
For the inputs and the button, I used the material UI library to generate the layout in code.


###  HTML Form Page

Once in the code, I began by installing create-react-app.
I have created input:text form to get input from the user, then added the 'get age' button to run the OnClick function.


### JS File

Installed and used the Axios library to data fetching.
Declared different variables, used useState to update the value of the function, created Arrow Function to ask data to the Api and return the predicted aged.
Used Catch Error to handling exeptions 
Created a function with handleKeyPress to allow the user to press enter in the keyboard to submit their input.


### CSS File

Used Materila UI library to create the input:text form and button. 
used SX Prop to customize some of the elements.
Used Media queries to create a responsive design


### Faced difficulties and features to implement in the future

On Sunday afternoon, I began studying the challenge, realizing that I needed to learn in order to develop it.
On Monday, I spent 2-3 hours learning how to build a website with React and how to use Apis.
Tuesday afternoon, I began coding development, first focusing on functionality and learning how axios interacts with JavaScript functions.
On Wednesday, I began the project from the ground up, focusing first on the design.
Thursday morning through evening, I finished the design details and then moved on to the project's functionality.
It must have taken me about 20 hours to develop it in total, including study and development time.


The challenges I faced were 

-Learning how to use a new language and its syntax
-Disorganization in project development, later realizing that it is better to start with design and then move on to usability
-Some technical issues putting together packages
